This is very early code of an effort to generalize a strategy we've used recently for creating static web projects like http://chicagotribune.com/flames and http://chicagotribune.com/pensions

The name is derived from Ben Welsh's django-bakery and expresses the idea that it's designed to produce "baked" static HTML pages which can be deployed to a simple http server rather than having to run a server which continually re-renders templates which are based on rarely-changing content.

It could probably be used in a live environment as well. We're still working out a lot of details...
